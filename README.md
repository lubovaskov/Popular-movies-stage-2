The MovieDB API Key:

The app needs an API key from https://www.themoviedb.org to work properly. This API key should be set in gradle.properties file, located in gradle user home directory (defined by the GRADLE_USER_HOME environment variable, which if not set defaults to USER_HOME/.gradle):

Example:

org.gradle.jvmargs=-XX\:MaxHeapSize\=256m -Xmx256m
TheMovieDBAPIKey="bf6092aeb60f45102c1ffff167bb54cd"
